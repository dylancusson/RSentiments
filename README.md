Sentiment Analysis of Top Reddit Posts and Comments from Political Subreddits

Initial version performs VADER sentiment analysis, however I find this to be a bit rudimentary as it has trouble with context and sarcasm.
Currently, data is saved to a CSV however future versions will implement some visualization of data.

Next version will be an upgrade to a more appropriate dataset like Sentiment140 or one from Hugging Face.
